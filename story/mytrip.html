	<h1> My Europe trip in 2018 </h2>
	<p> Back in 2018 when I got my master diploma I have decided to give myself a graduation gift and decided go on a Europe trip to discover  the European culture. The trip has been planned by myself and it was my first solo travel which I feel proud about. In this story map my goal is to show the places I have been to, give a bit background information about each destinations and encourage/motivate other travellers to discover exciting places in Europe! The destinations were as following: </p>
	<p> ** Hungary (Budapest) </p>
	<p> ** Czech Republic (Prague) </p>
	<p> ** Germany (Berlin) </p>
	<p> ** Germany (Munich) </p>
	<p> ** Germany (Dresden) </p>
	<p> ** Netherlands (Amsterdam) </p>
	<p> ** Spain (Barcelona) </p>
	<p> ** Spain (Madrid) </p>
	<p> ** Spain ( Valencia) </p>
	<h2> Hungary, Budapest </h2>
	<p> Budapest is the capital of Hungary, one of the most beautiful cities in Europe with an amazing range of incredible things to see and do. From the historical and gorgeous building, and delicious street food to Michelin star restaurants, steam baths, and buzzing ruin bar. I guarantee you’ll fall in love with the place, boasting of its amazing attractions.
It  is divided by the Danube river with on one side the hilly “Buda” area and the flat “Pest” side. I have spent only 3 days  and I'd say it was the best destination choice  to start off my trip. </p>
	<h2> Czech Republic, Prague </h2>
		<p> What a gorgeous city, I mean it! Lanes wind through towering buildings, each one ornately decorated with spired Gothic and baroque architecture. Best times to visit Prague are spring and early fall, and fortunately my trip was in September and I was able to enjoy the every single minute of it :) </p> 
	<h2> Germany - Berlin, Munich, Dresden </h2>
	<p> I have spent most of my time in Berlin, did  one day trip to Dresden and 2 days for Munich as I was looking for to explore Berlin more. Berlin is a gigantic city. I knew it was big, but until I decided to explore it by foot, I never knew just how big. From historical places to graffitis, museums, night life  it was just an incredible 5 days for me! Definitely recommended if you are young and want to feel European vibe, its your place to check it out! </p>
	<h2> Netherlands, Amsterdam </h2>
	<p> I truly love the international feel of the city and enjoy the visit here, by strolling along the beautiful canals and parks, and visiting the historic homes and Dutch village. One of my favorite cities in Europe. </p> 
	<h2> Spain - Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia </h2>
	<p>  Intentionally I kept Spain as my last destination, as my goal was to relax and enjoy the sunshine/beach as much as I could. Taking the time to fully explore Madrid, I found a massive city that required planning and organization to effectively explore. Valencia - A city that is split into the old and new city. Spent my first day soaking up the history of the charming old town on foot. Barcelona is hot and happening!There's always something to do in this bustling city. From sultry parties till sunrise to cool art exhibitions and beach volleyball sessions on the beaches. And of course Antoni Gaudi's art. I must say despite the fact that I have spent most of my days in Spain, it was just not enough for me as Barcelona had my heart! :)   </p>
